Before you ask any questions, please read the manual. 

Many features, like demuxing audio, setting AAC-sources to be HE-AAC, setting
default flags, are available through the right mouse button.

More notes:
- use Open-DML, legacy-index and RIFF AVI size = 1 MB to avoid that Win XP hangs 
  when clicking on an AVI file
- HE-AAC is not detected automatically! Only educated guesses are used. If HE-AAC
  is misdetected (positively or negatively) right-click on the stream and correct it
- Video lacing is a severe hack and only there for testing purposes! Use it on your
  own risk!
- most hardware mpeg4 (divX/xvid) players will reject Open-DML files or files with rec lists
  Soft-subs in AVI files usually don't work on such devices.
- Low-overhead-mode for AVI files is not compatible with some AVI readers.
